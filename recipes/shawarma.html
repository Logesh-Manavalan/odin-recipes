    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shawarma is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of Shawarma alternating with fillings such as ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.</p>
    <p>Shawarma (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the traditional form still being popular, Shawarma has taken on many different recipes over the years</p>
